### **Online Store Management Web API**

**Project Overview:**
This project is a robust and secure ASP.NET Core Web API designed to manage an online store, providing comprehensive functionality for product, order, and customer management. The API follows best practices in RESTful API design, ensuring that it is scalable, maintainable, and easy to integrate with various front-end applications or other systems.

**Features:**

1. **Product Management:**
   - **Create Product:** Add new products with essential details such as name, price, and stock quantity.
   - **Update Product:** Modify existing product information.
   - **Retrieve Products:** Fetch product details with options to filter by category, price range, and availability.
   - **Delete Product:** Remove products from the inventory.

2. **Order Management:**
   - **Create Order:** Place new orders with customer details and a list of products with quantities.
   - **Update Order:** Modify the status of an existing order (e.g., processing, shipped, delivered).
   - **Retrieve Orders:** Get order details with filters for customer, order date, and status.
   - **Delete Order:** Cancel existing orders.

3. **Customer Management:**
   - **Create Customer:** Register new customers with details like name, email, and phone number.
   - **Update Customer:** Update existing customer profiles.
   - **Retrieve Customers:** Fetch customer profiles with filters for name, email, and registration date.
   - **Delete Customer:** Remove customer profiles from the system.

**Technical Highlights:**

- **Middleware Implementation:**
  - **Request Logging:** Logs all incoming API requests, capturing details such as request path, headers, and query parameters.
  - **API Key Validation:** Secures the API by validating an API key in the request headers.

- **Data Validation:**
  - Ensures all input data (e.g., product details, customer information) is validated using data annotations, enforcing rules such as valid email formats and positive product prices.

- **Security:**
  - Implements security features like API key validation and JWT-based authentication to protect the API from unauthorized access.

- **Performance:**
  - Optimized for handling multiple requests concurrently, with proper error handling and validation to ensure efficient processing.

- **Documentation:**
  - Comprehensive API documentation generated using Swagger, detailing all available endpoints, required parameters, and possible responses for easy integration and usage.

**Special Considerations:**

- **Action Filters:** Custom action filters enforce specific business rules and log the execution time of critical operations.
- **Model Binding:** Simplifies the mapping of complex data structures from requests to corresponding C# classes.
- **Model Validation:** Ensures incoming data meets required standards before processing, improving data integrity.
